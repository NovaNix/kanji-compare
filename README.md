# Kanji Compare
A website to help tell the difference between two similar looking kanji.

Kanji are one of the hardest parts about learning Japanese. Sometimes when I've been learning I wished there was a place where I could easily compare two complicated kanji so I could differentiate them better. Thats why I made Kanji Compare!

This project uses a lot of data from other projects: 
- [KanjiVG](https://kanjivg.tagaini.net/)
- The [KANJIDIC Project](https://www.edrdg.org/wiki/index.php/KANJIDIC_Project)
- The [radkfile/kradfile](https://www.edrdg.org/krad/kradinf.html)

If I credited anyone incorrectly let me know so I can fix it.

[^note]: It looks like the original KanjiCafe site went down sometime in 2019, so I included the link to the wayback machine instead.
